# pickUpColour  
I want to create an app that stores beautiful scenes of films I love and allows me to create colour palettes from it.   

**User Story**
- Step 1 
 - [ ] As a user, I would like to upload images and store them on the site. *This requires an user account*
 - [ ] As a user, I would like to be able to **pick out colours from the image** I uploaded to create a colour palette. *Making a colour picker and figure out how to transport the selected colour to the colour bar would be the most challenging part I think.*
