# A place where I document the progress of this project.

A article I read this morning inspired this project. I love cinematography. I would to be able to keep a library of film scenes I love and make colour palettes out of it. I could do this using photoshop or softwares alike to do this,which would be much easier, but instead I think this project is a good challenge on programming. I'm alreday excited about how to make a colour picker tool!

I won't be able to focus on this project too much at the moment, as I want to concentrate on MyWords and my online portfolio. But I'll have the wireframe done first so I don't forgot. That's for now. *1356*
